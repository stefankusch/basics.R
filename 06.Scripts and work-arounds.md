As problems are encountered they need to be solved. Sometimes you may need a custom solution for your analysis, sometimes you need a standard function that solves your problem. Here, I collect such instances and how they were solved. 

1. Infinite values (-Inf, Inf, NA, ...)
2. 

#### Infinite values

Infinite values like `Inf`, `-Inf`, `NA`, or `NaN` can cause trouble in your analysis and are especially annoying in larger datasets. I found the following solution:

```
df <- as.data.frame(lapply(your.data, function(x){replace(x, x=="-Inf",0)}))
df <- as.data.frame(lapply(your.data, function(x){replace(x, x <0,0)}))
```
The first line finds all `-Inf` in the data frame of `your.data` and replaces them with `0`, the second line finds all values that are negative. I called the new data frame `df` here, but such replacements can also be run subsequently, naming the new data frame as the old. Some solutions claimed that e.g. `is.finite(NA)` or `is.infinite(Inf)` would help here as well, but that never worked in my case.
