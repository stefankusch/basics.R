**R** offers a lot of different plots, like line plots, bar plots, boxplots, histograms, PDA plots, and so on. In general, most of these plots can be generated with one line of command, but you may want to add more commands to add information and change the plot to your liking. 

#### General graphical parameters
First, there are graphical parameters that are useful for plotting and visual appeal. A few examples:
```
par(bty="o", mar=c(2,4,2,2)+0.1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
par(xpd=NA)
par(cex=1)
par(lwd=1)
```
`bty="o"` is the border type of the plot, o means all four borders are drawn. `mar=c()` defines the margins around the plot (bottom, left, top, right), which is important for labeling of the plot. `mfrow=c()` defines how many plots are drawn in one window (rows,columns). `xpd=NA` is recommended because it allows writing outside the plot. `cex=1` defines the relative font size, `lwd=1` the line width, where the standard is 1.

It is useful to define colors and sample names first, so that later you can just refer to the respective vector:
```
sample.names <- c("wild.type", "mutant1", "mutant2")
sample.colors <- c("white", "grey", "steelblue")
```

with `expression()`, one can write in bold or italics:
```
sample.names <- expression("wild type",italic("mutant1")~"-1",italic("mutant2"))
```

#### Plot graphical parameters
As you will see in the examples below, there are several parameters that can be defined in a plot. 
- `main=""` is the plot title (does not belong to professional figure)
- `ylim=c()` and `xlim=c()` defines the minimum and maximum axis values
- `ylab=""` and `xlab=""` defines the axis labels
- `names=` or `labels=` defines the sample names
- `col=` defines the sample colors
- `pch=` a number that defines the type and fill of data points
- `lwd=` specifies the line width; standard is 1
- `las=` tick mark lables orientation to axis; standard is 0 (as axis)
- `cex=` specifies the font size; standard is 1
- `yaxt=""` and `xaxt=""` define the axis, `"n"` means axis is not drawn

#### Bar plots
```
bar.data<-c(median(wild.type),median(mutant1),median(mutant2))
barplot(bar.data, main="bar plot", ylab="penetration [%]", ylim=c(0,100), 
  names.arg=c("wild.type", "mutant1", "mutant2"))
```

#### Boxplots
```
boxplot(your.data, main="boxplot", ylim=c(0,100), names=sample.names, 
  col=sample.colors, ylab="values", pch=19, las=2, lwd=1.5)
```

#### Dot- or Scatterplots
```
#define x and y to equal lengths
wt<-c(seq(1,1,length.out=4),seq(2,2,length.out=4),seq(3,3,length.out=4))
> wt
 [1] 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3
data.points<-c(your.data[,1],your.data[,2],your.data[,3])
#plot the data points
plot(wt, data.points, xlab="", ylab="values", pch=19,
  ylim=c(0,100), xlim=c(0.5,3.5), xaxt="n")
#add x-axis
axis(side = 1, at=c(1,2,3), lwd = 1, labels = sample.names)
```
