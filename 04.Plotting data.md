**R** offers a lot of different plots, like line plots, bar plots, boxplots, histograms, PDA plots, and so on. In general, most of these plots can be generated with one line of command, but you may want to add more commands to add information and change the plot to your liking. 

#### graphical parameters
First, there are graphical parameters that are useful for plotting and visual appeal. A few examples:
```
par(bty="o",mar=c(2,4,2,2)+0.1)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
par(xpd=NA)
par(cex=1)
par(lwd=1)
```
`bty="o"` is the border type of the plot, o means all four borders are drawn. `mar=c()` defines the margins around the plot (bottom, left, top, right), which is important for labeling of the plot. `mfrow=c()` defines how many plots are drawn in one window (rows,columns). `xpd=NA` is recommended because it allows writing outside the plot. `cex=1` defines the relative font size, `lwd=1` the line width, where the standard is 1.
