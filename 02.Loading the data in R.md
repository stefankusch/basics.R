When opening **R**, you will see the Console that contains some information such as the version you are using. 
In principle, one can work in the console, but it is not recommended. 
It is better to open a *script* with `Ctrl + N` or `File/New script`. 
All code can be written in this *script* and, importantly, it can be saved for later use. 
To run a line from the *script*, select the line and run it with `Ctrl + R`. Mutliple lines can be run at once.

The command to load a tab-delimited text file:
```
your.data <- read.table("PATH\\table.txt",header=TRUE, sep="\t")
```

Alternatively, to load the comma-delimited csv file:
```
> your.data <- read.csv("PATH\\table.csv",header=TRUE)
```

This teaches some basics about **R**:
- `your.data` is the name you give your dataset in **R**
- `<-` tells **R** that everything after this symbol belongs to `your.data`
- `read.table()` is the command
- `PATH` is the location of the file on your computer
- `header=TRUE` tells **R** that the first line of the data is the header
Note that the `PATH` in **R** requires `\\` instead of `\`, like `C:\\user\\documents\\file.txt`.


Next, we run a few lines to attach the data and check that it has been loaded correctly:
```
attach(your.data)
names(your.data)
head(your.data)
dim(your.data)
your.data
```
which looks like this in the console:
```
> attach(your.data)
> names(your.data)
[1] "wild.type" "mutant1"    "mutant2"  
> head(your.data)
  Ingrid mlo ror1
1     71 0.0   14
2     74 1.0   20
3     80 0.0   22
4     89 0.5   19
> dim(your.data)
[1] 4 3
> your.data
  wild.type mutant1 mutant2
1     71 0.0   14
2     74 1.0   20
3     80 0.0   22
4     89 0.5   19
``` 

This looks good - as you can see, the table looks like Type II (first part). `attach(your.data)` linked the data with **R**, `names(your.data)` lists the column names, `head(your.data)` shows the first six lines of the dataset, `dim(your.data)` gives a simple count of rows and columns (important for large datasets), and `your.data` shows the complete dataset, which is not recommended for larger datasets.
