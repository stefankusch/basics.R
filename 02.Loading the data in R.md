When opening **R**, you will see the Console that contains some information such as the version you are using. 
In principle, one can work in the console, but it is not recommended. 
It is better to open a *script* with `Ctrl + N` or `File/New script`. 
All code can be written in this *script* and, importantly, it can be saved for later use. 
To run a line from the *script*, select the line and run it with `Ctrl + R`. Mutliple lines can be run at once.
