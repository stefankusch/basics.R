**R** offers a lot of statistical tests, basically enabling all types of testing, be it parametric or non-parametric tests, pair-wise testing or multiple regression, and so on. You will find a solution for almost every statistical problem in the internet (e.g. see Useful links). For the kind of datasets that are produced very often in pathogen assays, pair-wise testing makes sense. In addition, one has to keep in mind that (a) the datasets are almost always very small (less than 15 independent replicates), and (b) in most cases do not show normal distribution.

#### Preparing dataset
As described in part 03 (Formatting the data), the dataset should be transformed to look like this:
```R
> head(data.melt)
     sample value
1 wild.type    71
2 wild.type    74
3 wild.type    80
4 wild.type    89
5   mutant1     0
6   mutant1     1
```

Now we can use `transform()` for any changes necessary. Let's assume that the data might be ratio type with 100 as maximum. 
```
> data.melt <- transform(data.melt, 
+ res = 100-value)
> head(data.melt)
     sample value res
1 wild.type    71  29
2 wild.type    74  26
3 wild.type    80  20
4 wild.type    89  11
5   mutant1     0 100
6   mutant1     1  99
```

#### Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test (non-parametric)

```
wilcox.test(value[1:8] ~ sample[1:8], data=data.melt)
```
produces a significant difference!
```R
        Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction

data:  value[1:8] by sample[1:8]
W = 16, p-value = 0.0294
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0

Warning message:
In wilcox.test.default(x = c(71, 74, 80, 89), y = c(0, 1, 0, 0.5 :
  cannot compute exact p-value with ties
```
