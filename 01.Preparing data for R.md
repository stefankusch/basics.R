To work with **R**, the data has to be in tabular format. If using *Excel*, mind the following points:
- use only the necessary columns and rows in your table
- avoid spaces in your row and column names
- use international format for numbers (decimal symbol is a dot, not a comma!)
- save your table as comma-delimited .csv or tab-delimited .txt

After saving, it is recommended to look at your table with a text editor. Depending on your method in **R** tables can be organized in different ways (here, tab-delimited):

Type I. 

```
sample  value1  value2  value3  value4
wild.type 71  74  80  89
mutant1   0   1   0   0.5
mutant2   14  20  22  19
``` 

Type II. 

``` 
wild.type  mutant1  mutant2
71   0   14
74   1   20
80   0   22
89   0.5 19
``` 

Type III. Used for various statistical methods

```
sample     value
wild.type  71
wild.type  74
wild.type  80
wild.type  89
mutant1    0
mutant1    1
mutant1    0
mutant1    0.5
mutant2    14
mutant2    20
mutant2    22
mutant2    19
``` 

This made-up dataset contains three samples (here, genotypes), with four values each. Type I is the usual way the table should look like, and **R** has methods to transform tables according to specific needs. 

*Note* | 
If instead of commas, there are semicolons, use "Replace all" in *Notepad* and replace ; with , in the prompt. Now we are ready for working with **R**.
