To work with **R**, the data has to be in tabular format. If using *Excel*, mind the following points:
- use only the necessary columns and rows in your table
- avoid spaces in your row and column names
- use international format for numbers (decimal symbol is a dot, not a comma!)
- save your table as comma-delimited .csv or tab-delimited .txt

After saving, it is recommended to look at your table with a text editor. Depending on your method in **R** tables can be organized in different ways (here, tab-delimited):

Type I. 

```
sample  value1  value2  value3  value4
wild.type 71  74  80  89
mutant1 0 1 0 0.5
mutant2 14  20  22  19
``` 

Type II. 

``` 
wild.type  mutant1 mutant2
71  0 14
74  1  20
80  0  22
89  0.5 19
``` 

Type III. Used for various statistical methods

```
sample  value
Ingrid  71
Ingrid  74
Ingrid  80
Ingrid  89
mlo 0
mlo 1
mlo 0
mlo 0.5
ror1  14
ror1  20
ror1  22
ror1  19
``` 

This made-up dataset contains three samples (here, genotypes), with four values each. Type I is the usual way the table should look like, and **R** has methods to transform tables according to specific needs.
