After the data was attached successfully, we can play with it. In the following, several useful operations are listed. 

#### Mathematical operations

```R
> mean(mutant2)
[1] 18.75
> median(mutant2)
[1] 19.5
> sd(mutant2)
[1] 3.40343
> log10(mutant2)
[1] 1.146128 1.301030 1.342423 1.278754
> length(mutant2)
[1] 4
```
Where `mean()` shows the mean of the vector, `median()` the median, `sd()` the standard deviation, `log10()` produces the 10th log of each point in the dataset, `length()` counts the number of data points in the vector. Standard mathematical operators for e.g. multiplication `*`, division `/`, and sum `sum()` work as well and can be integrated into commands. 


#### Calling data

```R
> your.data[1]
  wild.type
1     71
2     74
3     80
4     89
> your.data[2,]
  wild.type mutant1 mutant2
2     74   1   20
> your.data[,2]
[1] 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.5
> your.data[2,2]
[1] 1
> your.data[1:3]
  wild.type mutant1 mutant2
1     71 0.0   14
2     74 1.0   20
3     80 0.0   22
4     89 0.5   19
```
The number in the brackets defines which row or column is selected. We can use a few operators to specify: `[2]` shows column 2, `[,2]` shows the data points of column 2, `[2,]` selects row 2, `[2,2]` shows the value found in row 2 of column 2, and `[1:3]` shows columns 1 to 3. The operators can also be combined, e.g. `[,4:7]`.


#### Formatting the data

There are several ways in **R** to format the data, e.g. `data.frame()`, `transform()`, `merge()`, and `melt()`. This can be very important for certain operations and analyses. 


`data.frame()` enables re-ordering of columns, or merging columns from different datasets into one data frame. In this case, we combine formatting with producing the log10 values for each gene and condition with `log10(rna.data[3:5]`. 
```R
> rna.data <- read.table("PATH\\RNAseq_fpkm.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
> head(rna.data)
  identifier contr.rep1 contr.rep2 contr.rep3 stress.rep1 stress.rep2 stress.rep3
1 gene1  97.51506   61.65512   59.40646   33.74849   81.40597    62.89473
2 gene2 136.45761   52.26186   54.10862   24.03821  119.74967    46.72238
3 gene3  74.57049   51.23117   37.42240   52.77092   70.48903    50.58769
4 gene4 100.63628   92.35787   62.49370   59.67882   95.64046   101.02357
5 gene5 125.28684   59.88186   47.08829   40.54740  129.95503    59.64367
6 gene6 106.81007   75.49438   43.30486   92.41619  101.17756    87.04732
> subset.data <- data.frame(rna.data[1], log10(rna.data[3:5]))
> head(subset.data)
  identifier contr.rep2 contr.rep3 stress.rep1
1 gene1   1.789969   1.773834   1.528254
2 gene2   1.718185   1.733266   1.380902
3 gene3   1.709534   1.573132   1.722395
4 gene4   1.965474   1.795836   1.775820
5 gene5   1.777295   1.672913   1.607963
6 gene6   1.877915   1.636537   1.965748
```


`melt()` can simplify the data frame, making it usable for operations like heatmaps or statistical tests. We use `names(data.melt)[1:2]` to assign header names to columns 1 and 2. 
```R
> data.melt <- melt(your.data)
No id variables; using all as measure variables
> names(data.melt)[1:2] <- c("sample", "value")
> head(data.melt)
     sample value
1 wild.type    71
2 wild.type    74
3 wild.type    80
4 wild.type    89
5   mutant1     0
6   mutant1     1
```


`t()` can transpose the dataset, if required. Here, we need to re-name the headers with `colnames()`.
```R
> head(data.set)
      identifier sample1  sample2
1 gene1  1.919393 -0.1011141
2 gene2  2.949256  1.5648836
3 gene3  3.096540  1.5729563
> data.t <- as.data.frame(t(data.set[,-1]))
> colnames(data.t) <- data.set[,1]
> head(data.t)
                 gene1          gene2          gene3
sample1      1.9193927       2.949256       3.096540
sample2     -0.1011141       1.564884       1.572956
```


`transform()` is very useful, as it allows for example the addition of new columns, or comparison between columns with mathematical operations. `wt.log = log2(wild.type)` means that the new column `wt.log` contains the log2 values from the column `wild.type`. 
```R
> your.data <- transform(your.data, 
+ wt.log = log2(wild.type),
+ m1.log = log2(mutant1),
+ m2.log = log2(mutant2))
> head(your.data)
  wild.type mutant1 mutant2   wt.log m1.log   m2.log
1        71     0.0      14 6.149747   -Inf 3.807355
2        74     1.0      20 6.209453      0 4.321928
3        80     0.0      22 6.321928   -Inf 4.459432
4        89     0.5      19 6.475733     -1 4.247928
```


`merge()` allows the comparison of two lists to generate a third list with only custom lines and columns, e.g. including only matches between the lists and printing all respective values. In the following example, we compare a list of genes of interest `gene.list` that contains only a header (in this case, called identifier) and gene names, with the `rna.data` from above. `by = "identifier"` defines that the gene identifiers columns are used for list comparison. `all.x = TRUE` tells **R** to only take the rows from `rna.data` with matches in the `gene.list`. Of course, we can also merge all information from two tables with several columns each, i.e. the matching rows, in one table with this function. 
```R
list.interest <- merge(gene.list, rna.data, by = "identifier", 
	all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE, sort = TRUE)
``` 


#### Writing tables to files

Of course, a lot of operations are carried out in **R**, resulting in tables that you might want to use later for further analysis, to save for later publication, or to work with them in different software. 
```
write.table(data.table, "PATH\\your.awesome.table.txt",sep="\t")
#or
write.csv(data.table, "PATH\\your.awesome.table.csv")
```
