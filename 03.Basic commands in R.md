After the data was attached successfully, we can play with it. In the following, several useful operations are listed. 

#####Mathematical operations

```R
> mean(mutant2)
[1] 18.75
> median(mutant2)
[1] 19.5
> sd(mutant2)
[1] 3.40343
> log10(mutant2)
[1] 1.146128 1.301030 1.342423 1.278754
> length(mutant2)
[1] 4
```
Where `mean()` shows the mean of the vector, `median()` the median, `sd()` the standard deviation, `log10()` produces the 10^th log of the dataset, `length()` counts the number of data points in the vector. Standard mathematical operators for e.g. multiplication `*`, division `/`, and sum `sum()` work as well and can be integrated into commands. 


####Calling data

```R
> your.data[1]
  wild.type
1     71
2     74
3     80
4     89
> your.data[2,]
  wild.type mutant1 mutant2
2     74   1   20
> your.data[,2]
[1] 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.5
> your.data[2,2]
[1] 1
> your.data[1:3]
  wild.type mutant1 mutant2
1     71 0.0   14
2     74 1.0   20
3     80 0.0   22
4     89 0.5   19
```
The number in the brackets defines which row or column is selected. We can use a few operators to specify: `[2]` shows column 2, `[,2]` shows the data points of column 2, `[2,]` selects row 2, `[2,2]` shows the value found in row 2 of column 2, and `[1:3]` shows columns 1 to 3. The operators can also be combined, e.g. `[,4:7]`.
